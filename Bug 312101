//This patch is regarding the bug which in my opinion is solved.


In the playlistmodel.cpp which is written by Sinny Kumari , the function PlaylistModel () , the following patch is there which looks perfect to me regarding adding multiple media to a playlist~~~

void PlaylistModel::addToPlaylist(const QString& url, const QString& name)
{
    const int n = rowCount();
    beginInsertRows(QModelIndex(), n, n);      // This also should work fine in accordance with QAbstractItemModel class propertiest pull
    

    PlaylistItem item;
    item.setMediaName(name);
    item.setMediaUrl(url);
    m_musicList.append(item);

    endInsertRows();
}





I have again tried to reproduce the bug, and I dont find any issues. So I would suggest closing the bug if you feel right.
